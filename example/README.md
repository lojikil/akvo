# Quick Note

I usually just run these with `PYTHONPATH=. python3 example/if-construction0.py` from the top-level directory

# Files

- `current.py`: a running example of the API, attempting to keep a current look at the language
- `if-construction0.py`: a simple if-construction

I usually have a "current" file for every language I write; it is meant to hold a "current" example of the language, and then
all other examples can be updated from that
